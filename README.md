# giftastic

I created a webpage where I search different NewGirl gif topics and clicking the buttons will pull up the top 10 relevant gifs. 


index.html:

Essentially this page just has a couple added buttons (pulled from app.js file) and a text box to fill the desired topic. The bottom area will fill up with 10 gifs.

style.css

this page made some minor adjustment to gif sizes, color, some bootstrap functionality with container-fill, and background color.


app.jss
 
By following the comments on the javascript page, you will see the code and what kind of functionality it is doing.
